### **Title**  
To build an interactive SVG Drawing Tool using front-end technologies.

---

### **Approach**

In this experiment, an SVG Drawing Tool was designed and developed to allow users to draw shapes interactively using mouse actions. The aim was to understand SVG handling and mouse event processing.

* An SVG canvas was created to serve as the drawing area.  
* Mouse events such as click, move, and release were used to track drawing actions.  
* JavaScript was used to create and manipulate SVG shapes dynamically.  
* Features like color selection and undo functionality were implemented for better usability.  
* Responsive design was achieved using viewport-based units.

This approach helps in understanding SVG graphics, event handling, and interactive UI development.

* Understood the basics of SVG and its usage in web applications.  
* Learned to handle mouse events for interactive drawing.  
* Gained experience in dynamically creating and modifying SVG elements.  
* Improved knowledge of building responsive and interactive front-end tools.
